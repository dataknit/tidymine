## Motivation

We often want to work out which variables are most relevant for predicting or describing another.

## The Limitations of Correlation

Correlation struggles with this because it is mainly limited to recognising linear patterns.

Here are some examples.

## MINE Statistics

MINE statistics get around this problem.

```{r}
mlb_2008 %>%
  tidymine(salary) %>%
  arrange(-mic)
```
